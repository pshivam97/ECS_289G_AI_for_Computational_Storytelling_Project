Oops
An Interactive Fiction by Kunlin
Release 1 / Serial number 220305 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Deep Forest
Oops, you are lost in a deep forest. The trees grow so close together that you cannot see the moon or the sky, and no animals or small plants thrive on the ground. It seems dangerous around, so keep your eyes sharp...

and...

try to go somewhere.

wait...

there's a ball in your pocket!

Some plants can even speak!
